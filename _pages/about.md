Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science and Economics at Yale University, where I focus on political economy in the context of business-government relations and good governance. My research interests mainly revolve around the determinants and effects of firms' political activities, with applications to the European Union and US state politics. I am furthermore interested in how potentially induced distortions in this context may be mitigated by electoral accountability and institutions.
Additionally, I study how trust affects public policy effectiveness, with applications to COVID-19 mitigation policies. My work (joint with Daniel A. N. Goldstein) has been published in _Perspectives on Politics_.

I hold a BA from the University of Konstanz, and an MSc from the London School of Economics, as well as an MA and an MPhil from Yale University. Before coming to Yale, I have worked at the World Bank, and interned at the German Embassy in New Delhi, the German-Arab Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Cairo, and the German Bundestag in Berlin. Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking and various US late night shows.
