I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science and Economics at Yale University, where I focus on political economy in the context of business-government relations and governance. My research interests mainly revolve around the determinants and effects of firms' political activities in the context of the European Union and US state politics. I am furthermore interested in how electoral accountability and institutions may moderate these effects.
Additionally, I study how trust and partisanship affect public policy effectiveness, with applications to COVID-19 mitigation policies. My work (joint with Daniel A. N. Goldstein) has been published in _Perspectives on Politics_.

I hold a BA from the University of Konstanz, and an MSc from the London School of Economics, as well as an MA and an MPhil from Yale University. Before coming to Yale, I have worked at the World Bank, and interned at the German Embassy in New Delhi, the German-Arab Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Cairo, and the German Bundestag in Berlin. Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking and late night shows.

I will join Uber as an Applied Scientist in Fall 2022.
