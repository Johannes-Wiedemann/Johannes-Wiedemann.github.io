There is anecdotal evidence that political connections to state attorney generals in the US may be beneficial for firms, for instance through decresased law enforcement stringency. I analyze the firm-level effects of political connections to state attorney generals as they have been established through campaign contributions. Employing a regression discontuity design, I show that political connections to state attorney generals lead to increases in firm-level investments; I provide suggestive evidence that these effects might be due to decreased uncertainty in the business environment, as manifested in a lowered latent risk of being investigated and/or penalized by a state attorney general. I find that accountability and partisanship of the legislature and the governor moderate these effects, and provide suggestive evidence that connected firms display a larger long-term size growth. The observed firm-level investment effects may be inefficient as capital may be misallocated across firms.
