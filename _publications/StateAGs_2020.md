The literature on political connections of firms predominantly focuses on the legislative branch and – to a lesser extent – on the executive branch. However, companies may also benefit from political connections to the judicial branch. In this paper I shed light on this phenomenon by examining the effects of firms’ political connections to state attorneys general (state AGs) in the US. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these connections may be beneficial for firms, as they may contribute to decreased law enforcement stringency that firms face. I leverage campaign contribution data to operationalize firm-state AG political connections. Employing a regression discontinuity design, I show that political connections to state AGs lead to increases in firms’ investments. I provide suggestive evidence that these effects might be due to the reduced uncertainty in the business environment, as manifested in a lowered latent risk of being investigated and/or penalized by connected state AGs. The observed investment effects may be inefficient as capital may be misallocated across firms.
