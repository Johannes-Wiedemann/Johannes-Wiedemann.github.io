The EU Single Market is the largest internal market worldwide in terms of GDP, and the EU has far-reaching policy authority. Hence, policy stakes are high, and a wide array of actors tries to exert influence on the EU level; private companies play a prominent role in this process. Yet, a systematic empirical account of the determinants and effects of firm lobbying in the EU is lacking. First, I document that larger, more profitable, and more valuable companies lobby more, and that firms strategically choose lobbying targets within the European multilevel political structure. I then explore the effects of firm lobbying in the EU, and show that stock markets value firm lobbying, employing an event study approach and a difference-in-differences design. Examining mechanisms, I demonstrate that firm lobbying is associated with companies receiving higher grant amounts from the EU Commission. I argue for a causal interpretation of this finding based on an instrumental variable design. Further analyses imply that these results may generalize to regulatory politics in the EU; lobbying companies may benefit from more favorable regulations. I discuss the findings against the backdrop of the literature, and argue that while lobbying in the EU context may best be viewed as informational rather than quid-pro-quo, i.e. companies provide information rather than resources, it may nonetheless entail private benefits to firms.
