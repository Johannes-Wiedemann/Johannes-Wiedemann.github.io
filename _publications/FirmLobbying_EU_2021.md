The number of lobbyists in Brussels is the second-highest worldwide, and there is a wide array of anecdotal evidence for corporate lobbying in the European Union (EU). Yet, a systematic empirical account of the determinants and effects of firm lobbying in the EU has been lacking. I document that larger and more profitable companies lobby more, and that firms strategically choose lobbying targets within the European multilevel political structure. Firm lobbying leads to companies receiving higher amounts of grants from the EU Commission. I argue for a causal interpretation of this finding based on two instrumental variable designs. Additionally, I show that stock markets value firm lobbying, employing an event study approach. Taken together, the results suggest that firm lobbying in the EU induces allocative distortions; however, their magnitude may be moderate due to the self-selection of 'high quality' firms into lobbying. I provide evidence that suggests that these results may generalize to EU regulatory politics. Lastly, I discuss the findings against the backdrop of the literature, and argue that while lobbying in the EU context may best be viewed as informational, it may nonetheless entail private benefits to firms.
